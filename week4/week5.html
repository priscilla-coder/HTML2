            <p id="description">There’s a particular kind of heartbreak that lives not in screaming matches or
                 tearful goodbyes—it lingers instead in mere and absolute silence. In the messages we type out, stare 
                 at for hours, and never send. In the punctuation of paragraphs left unfinished in our Notes app.
                  In the voice memos we record, replay, and then delete. These are not door slams or blocked numbers.
                   They are the fading, the unsaid, the “Maybe I shouldn’t” that jams itself into our hearts and keeps 
                   us awake at 2 a.m. Humans crave resolution, beginning, middle, end. We want to understand why someone left,
                    why they didn’t choose us, why we weren’t enough, why we can’t seem to move on even when everything rational
                     tells us to.

                The truth of the matter is, not all stories have clear endings, some just stop mid-sentence,
                 mid-thought, mid-feeling, mid-possibility. And we’re left writing and rewriting the rest of the story in our
                  heads, in our journals, and in those unsent texts that say everything, but also nothing at all. The “I miss you but I shouldn’t,” the 
                  “This hurt me and I don’t know how to tell you,” and the “Did I ever mean anything to you?” Are thoughts that
                   outlive the moment, they are full of everything we couldn’t say, either out of pride or fear or self-preservation. 
                   They’re the emotional debris of almosts and could-have-beens. They are love letters to versions of us that loved
                    without logic and hoped, without hesitation.</p>
